# Stylus Skeleton

This project is the base setup for CSS styles for any site. I've taken the useful (opinionated) parts from (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ "Normalize.css"), broken them into smaller modules and added base styling for items like responsive typography. This was done to
* create a more module system for managing styles
* combine Normalize recommendations with my base styles.

This is all still very much in the works, but provides a clean start for most projects. And the structure makes it very easy to change and update properties such as font-face and color.
